# KubernetesExamples
Kubernetes Example software

This Example has a generic Node.js file that can be used as a Docker/ K8s pod.  We also have a generic template.yml that we can export variables to, via DockerGeneric.

These examples do NOT have company/AWS specific information in them, for obvious reasons.

As I genericize my work, it will be uploaded.

Due to having to bowlderize large swaths of each of my scripts, there is no gurantee they will work as is; so please proceed with caution.
